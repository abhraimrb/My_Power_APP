# My_Power_APP

This App will be used for calculating Active, Reactive and Apparent Power for a single phase Electrical circuit.

For Getting the Power values, just input the Resistance,Inductive Reactance, And Capacitative reactance Values in Ohms in Respective
 fields.The App will Calculate the Active, Reactive, Apparent Power, and the Impedance(Total Effective Resistance of the Circuit) of the single phase circuit.
 
 Shiny package needs to be installed prior to running the App.
